### Spectral Brand Theory (Zharnikov 2026a)

Introduces the full SBT framework: eight perceptual dimensions, observer spectral profiles, cloud formation and conviction collapse, and the seven-metric coherence scorecard. Validated across five brands (Hermes, IKEA, Patagonia, Tesla, Erewhon). Reports four novel mechanisms: structural absence (dark signals), five-type coherence taxonomy, asymmetric conviction resilience, and brand power/health independence.

**Keywords**: brand perception, computational branding, observer heterogeneity, brand coherence, structural absence, AI-native framework

### The Atom-Cloud-Fact Epistemological Pipeline (Zharnikov 2026b)

Describes the domain-agnostic epistemological architecture underlying SBT. Originally developed for probabilistic financial fact extraction, the atom-cloud-fact pipeline provides the formal machinery for observation-to-knowledge progression. Documents the architecture, its seven principles, and the domain transfer from financial document processing to brand perception modeling.

**Keywords**: epistemology, probabilistic knowledge, atom-cloud-fact, domain transfer, computational framework
