### Spectral Brand Theory: A Computational Framework for Multi-Dimensional Brand Perception

**Author:** Dmitry Zharnikov | **Status:** Working paper, February 2026

Introduces the full SBT framework: eight perceptual dimensions, observer spectral profiles, cloud formation and conviction collapse, and the seven-metric coherence scorecard. Validated across five brands (Hermes, IKEA, Patagonia, Tesla, Erewhon). Reports four novel mechanisms: structural absence (dark signals), five-type coherence taxonomy, asymmetric conviction resilience, and brand power/health independence.

### The Atom-Cloud-Fact Epistemological Pipeline: From Financial Document Processing to Brand Perception Modeling

**Author:** Dmitry Zharnikov | **Status:** Working paper, February 2026

Describes the domain-agnostic epistemological architecture underlying SBT. Originally developed for probabilistic financial fact extraction, the atom-cloud-fact pipeline provides the formal machinery for observation-to-knowledge progression that SBT applies to brand perception. This paper documents the architecture, its seven principles, and the domain transfer.
